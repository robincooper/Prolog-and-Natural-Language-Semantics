# Prolog and Natural Language Semantics
 Used for teaching computational semantics in 80's and 90's in the Department of AI, Edinburgh University.  The course notes are in the file `Prolog_and_Natural_Language_Semantics.pdf`.  Note that Chap. 6 of these notes refers to a directory `chat` which has not been included in this repository as it is an independent system written by Fernando Pereira and David Warren which the code presented here could interface with.
